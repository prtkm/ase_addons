ase_addons
==========

=ase_addons= is a module that stores bulk structures, surfaces, and other convenience functions that I have created and used during my PhD. Usage of this requires the atomic simulation environment (ASE).

To use this module, simply add this folder into your $PYTHONPATH variable.
